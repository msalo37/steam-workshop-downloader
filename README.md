Now the program almost does not work, due to the fact that steamworkshopdownloader.io no longer works. Now downloading mods comes from steamworkshop.download

Site can download mods, or can send an error instead of a download link, but it downloaded all the mods that I tested (popular mods from rimworld)

Once you have selected all mods, check that all fields are correct and click on the "Download all mods" button. All mods will be downloaded and unpacked to the specified folder. Wait for a sound signal or an inscription about the end of the download.
