As soon as you open the program, you need to choose the path to the mods for the game and the [server url](https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/) (just copy it at the bottom of the page and paste it). Next, you need to add all the mods that you need to the list on the left, at the top of it there is a TextBox, you need to insert a link or id from the workshop into it and press enter.

Once you have selected all mods, check that all fields are correct and click on the "Download all mods" button. All mods will be downloaded and unpacked to the specified folder. Wait for a sound signal or an inscription about the end of the download.
